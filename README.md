# EECS 595 final project

From Patrick Sherry

Copied Verifiable Coherent NLU project and modified it, see original readme in the folder for details

I haven't really added anything other than getting the jupyter notebook for the TRIP project (Verifiable Coherent NLU) to run on a great lakes node. The one thing I did for this other than remove some things I didn't have dependencies for is add the dataset with just 10 stories, but that should still link to the same place
